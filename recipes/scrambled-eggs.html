        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This recipe is useful for when you don't care for the taste what you're eating, don't want to put much effort into preparing food, but still want something that is healthy & nutritious. I like to prepare it when I want to put my focus & attention into a project, but don't want to be shaky & irritable while working on it.</p>
        <p>It's pretty difficult to mess up scrambled eggs. I'd wager a guess that this tastes pretty good, although I haven't had it so I wouldn't know</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 large eggs</li>
            <li>1/4 cup milk</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon of salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Cooking Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Break the eggs into a microwave-proof mixing bowl. Add milk and salt; mix well.</li>
            <li>Pop the bowl into the microwave and cook on high power for 30 seconds. Remove bowl, beat eggs very well, scraping down the sides of the bowl, and return to the microwave for another 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>Repeat this pattern, stirring every 30 seconds for up to 2 1/2 minutes. Stop when eggs have the consistency you desire.</li>
            <li>Serve warm and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
