        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>This recipe is useful for when you don't care for the taste what you're eating, don't want to put much effort into preparing food, but still want something that is healthy & nutritious. I like to prepare it when I want to put my focus & attention into a project, but don't want to be shaky & irritable while working on it.</p>
        <p>The taste is passable enough to eat, but not particularly enjoyable. If you're looking for something that tastes a little better, I'd suggest taking a look at some of the other recipes on this website.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1-2 Russet potatos</li>
            <li>2-3 Frozen chicken tenderloins</li>
            <li>A salt shaker</li>
            <li>Distilled water</li>
        </ul>
